A set of AI-enabled effects, generators, and analyzers for [Audacity¬Æ](https://www.audacityteam.org/). These AI features run 100% locally on your PC :computer: -- no internet connection necessary! [OpenVINO‚Ñ¢](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino) is used to run AI models on supported accelerators found on the user's system such as CPU, GPU, and NPU.

- [**Music Separation**](doc/feature_doc/music_separation/README.md):musical_note: -- Separate a mono or stereo track into individual stems -- Drums, Bass, Vocals, & Other Instruments. 
- [**Noise Suppression**](doc/feature_doc/noise_suppression/README.md):broom: -- Removes background noise from an audio sample.
- [**Music Generation & Continuation**](doc/feature_doc/music_generation/README.md):notes: -- Uses MusicGen LLM to generate snippets of music, or to generate a continuation of an existing snippet of music.
- [**Whisper Transcription**](doc/feature_doc/whisper_transcription/README.md):microphone: -- Uses [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) to generate a label track containing the transcription or translation for a given selection of spoken audio or vocals.

* Audacity¬Æ development team & Muse Group-- Thank you for your support!  
* Audacity¬Æ GitHub -- https://github.com/audacity/audacity  
* Whisper transcription & translation analyzer uses whisper.cpp (with OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ backend): https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp  
* Music Generation & Continuation use MusicGen model, from Meta.
  - We currently have support for [MusicGen-Small](https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-small), and [MusicGen-Small-Stereo](https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-stereo-small)
  - The txt-to-music pipelines were ported from python to C++, referencing logic from the Hugging Face transformers project: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers 
* Music Separation effect uses Meta's Demucs v4 model (https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs), which has been ported to work with OpenVINO‚Ñ¢  
* Noise Suppression:
  * noise-suppression-denseunet-ll:  from OpenVINO‚Ñ¢'s Open Model Zoo: https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo   
  * DeepFilterNet2 & DeepFilterNet3:
    * Ported the models & pipeline from here: https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet  
    * We also made use of @grazder's fork / branch (https://github.com/grazder/DeepFilterNet/tree/torchDF-changes) to better understand the Rust implementation, and so we also based some of our C++ implementation on ```torch_df_offline.py``` found here.
